# Analytics Dashboard Setup Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Neon Database

1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and create an account
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your connection string from the dashboard
   - It looks like: `postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`

### 2. Initialize the Database

1. Open your Neon SQL Editor (in the Neon Console)
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `lib/schema.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute the SQL
4. You should see a success message confirming the tables were created

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-actual-connection-string-here
ANALYTICS_USERNAME=admin
ANALYTICS_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!
```

**Important**: Choose a strong password for `ANALYTICS_PASSWORD`!

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then:
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and ask a few questions
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/analytics`
3. Login with your credentials (username: admin, password: what you set)
4. You should see the analytics dashboard with your test data!

### 5. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Import Project
3. Select your repository
4. Add Environment Variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = your Neon connection string
   - `ANALYTICS_USERNAME` = admin
   - `ANALYTICS_PASSWORD` = your secure password
5. Deploy!

### 6. Access Production Analytics

Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/analytics`

- Date range filters (7 days, 30 days, all time)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to database
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- Make sure it includes `?sslmode=require`
- Check your Neon project is active

### No data showing up
- Ask some questions in the chatbot first
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the tracking API is working: `/api/analytics/track`

### Can't login to analytics
- Double-check `ANALYTICS_USERNAME` and `ANALYTICS_PASSWORD` in env vars
- Try a fresh browser session (clear cookies)
- In Vercel, make sure env vars are saved and redeployed

### Database schema errors
- Make sure you ran ALL the SQL from `lib/schema.sql`
- Check that both tables (`chat_analytics` and `chat_sessions`) were created
- Verify indexes were created

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ Uses HTTP Basic Authentication
- ‚úÖ Password is never stored in code
- ‚úÖ Credentials checked on every request
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use a strong password
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env.local` to git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always use HTTPS in production (Vercel does this automatically)
